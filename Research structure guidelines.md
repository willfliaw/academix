# Introduction

- Elaborate about the context, history, problem and why it is relevant.

# Literature review

- Sistematic review of related literature up to the state of the art.
- Highlight advantages, disadvantages and gaps of current knowledge.
- What is the objective in more detail and how it fills the gap.
- Can the objective's results be verified?
- Justify how the results will be measured.

# Methodology

- How is the objective fulfilled (methods) and why choose this approach?
- How are the results/hipothesis tested and why it is the best choice?
- Indicate limitations and potential solutions to the methodology proposed.

# Results

- Describe the results and how they were achieved (proofs).
- Critique analysis of results and their evidences (simulations, observations, etc).
- Relate cause and effect, make generalizations through observations and analysis, explain contradictions, define limitations, suggest further research.
- Justify everything with evidence or logic.

# Conclusion
