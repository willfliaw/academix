\chapter{Introduction} \label{chap:intro}

Here you should give the context, justifications...

Do yourself a favor and follow the structure guidelines in the file \texttt{Research struc\-ture guidelines.md}. It should make your life easier.

In this template I will leave examples on how to cite, reference chapters, tables, figures, use math symbols along the text, write equations, label them for further referencing, use cases in equations, write tables, include figures, use special math formatting and symbols, use proof environments for theorems, matrix environments, etc. Remember to build the main file \texttt{thesis\_main.tex} to visualize the updated pdf.

Example of how to reference a chapter: This dissertation is structured in several chapters. In Chapter \ref{chap:lit}, we present a detailed review of the literature, highlighting key contributions in the field. For example, the work by Doe and Smith \cite{doe0000} provides a foundational analysis on this topic, which serves as a basis for the methodology discussed in Chapter \ref{chap:method}.
