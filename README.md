## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer: CamelCase Style

LaTeX traditionally uses lowercase commands and variable names, albeit inconsistently. While this convention is widely followed, the Academix template adopts the **camelCase style** for its custom commands and variables. The rationale behind this choice includes:

- **Readability**: camelCase commands are easier to read and distinguish from LaTeX's default commands.
- **Consistency**: A consistent naming style is preferable to an inconsistent mix of styles.
- **Separation**: Custom commands contrast clearly with LaTeX's built-in parameters, reducing ambiguity.

It‚Äôs important to note:
- Default LaTeX objects that have been redefined in Academix retain their original names for compatibility.
- This decision prioritizes usability and clarity for users of the template.

While this approach may differ from LaTeX conventions, it is designed to enhance the user experience by providing a structured and easily recognizable command style.
